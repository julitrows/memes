# Memes folder for everyday use

## Why?

Having a handy folder of memes at your fingertips is a true superpower in the world of tech. Whether you’re writing documentation, chatting on Slack, or reviewing code, the right meme can break the ice, lighten the mood, and make your message stick.

When it comes to documentation, a well-placed meme can turn a wall of text into something memorable and approachable. It helps readers connect with the content, making even the driest technical details a little more fun.

In Slack conversations, memes are the universal language. They help you celebrate wins, commiserate over bugs, and keep the team spirit high—even on a Monday morning. A quick meme can say what words can’t, and sometimes, that’s exactly what your team needs.

And let’s not forget code reviews! Dropping a meme in a pull request can soften the blow of tough feedback, celebrate a clever solution, or just remind everyone that we’re all human behind the keyboard.

So, keep that meme folder close. It’s not just for laughs—it’s a secret weapon for better communication, stronger teams, and a happier workday.

## How to use this

1. Checkout the repo
2. In macos I like having the folder pinned to my dock, with the "view as stack" setting. This allows me to click, see what I have, pick one, then drag & drop on the slack convo, confluence document or github comment.
3. Add new memes whenever the chance arises.
4. Keep your meme game fresh and elite. That's really how you get to post-senior positions!
5. Have fun while doing this.
